            <h1>WE NEED YOUR HELP</h1>
            <p>Your monthly sponsorship donation to help a child in Africa actually benefits the child's entire
                family.

                Children receive nutritious food, medical services, educational tutoring, clean water,
                extracurricular
                activities, and service opportunities.
                Adolescents receive vocational training in carpentry, tailoring, crocheting, etc., so they can help
                the
                family and prepare for their future.
                Parents can participate in adult literacy classes as well as quarterly classes on topics addressing
                hygiene, parenting, and sanitation. They also have access to income-generation training.
                Join with us today. Donate to help children in Africa. You can make a lasting difference!

                <h3>Education</h3>
                <p>Your donations matter to young eager scholars and their communities.
                    You can make a world of difference.

                    One way you can help is by sponsoring a child’s education through
                    monthly giving. You can be the person who opens the door to education
                    for a deserving student in need.

                    Another way is by donating to help cover the cost of shipping the
                    books and school supplies. Every week we receive several boxes of
                    supplies and we need help on an on-going basis with covering the
                    shipping costs. A single drum costs over $200 to ship to Africa.
                    Every dollar donated gets us one step closer to getting these supplies
                    into children's hands.

                <h3>Medical</h3>
                <p>Health care in Sub-Saharan Africa remains the worst in the world,
                    with few countries able to spend the $34 to $40 a year per person
                    that the World Health Organization considers the minimum for basic
                    health care. And despite widespread poverty, an astonishing 50
                    percent of the region’s health expenditure is financed by
                    out-of-pocket payments from individuals.

                    Donor attention has yielded remarkable efforts to fight HIV/AIDS,
                    tuberculosis, and malaria. But most of the region lacks the
                    infrastructure to deliver health care and faces a severe shortage
                    of trained medical personnel. As Africa's economies improve,
                    the demand for good quality health care
                    will only increase further.</p>

                <p>We do not only turn your unwanted items into cash to help people
                    in crisis across Sub-Saharan Africa, we also send large amount of
                    clothes to Africa. We donate all clothes we send to Africa to help
                    victims of poverty. Please give us your unwanted clothes so that we can
                    help vulnerable people.
